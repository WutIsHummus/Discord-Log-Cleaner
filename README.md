# Discord Log CLeaner

Format your discord logs exported using [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter), so you can make your own gpt with [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT)


### How to use 

Have your chat export on the same directory and rename it to be "input.txt"<br>
Run the step#.py files in order <br>
Your final txt file should be called "OutputFinal.txt"

*If your discord logs are absolute brain rot and random bs, dont expect much from the gpt. ðŸ™‚*
